Description: Tiny and efficient C++/Python bindings
 nanobind is a small binding library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice
 versa. It is reminiscent of Boost.Python and pybind11 and uses near-identical
 syntax. In contrast to these existing tools, nanobind is more efficient:
 bindings compile in a shorter amount of time, produce smaller binaries, and
 have better runtime performance.
